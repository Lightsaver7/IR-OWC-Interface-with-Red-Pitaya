# IR-OWC-Interface-with-Red-Pitaya

This repository contains the transmission code for creating an Infrared Receiver & Transmitter using a Red Pitaya at a frequency of 57.6 kHz.

The Redpitaya_FPGA file includes the starting code to implement the project in FPGA using Vivado 2020.1. The project was tested and created for Red Pitaya OS 1.04-28.

Please note that, the code is incomplete and would be better split between multiple smaller files.
